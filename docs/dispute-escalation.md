# Dispute Escalation Contract

Three-tier dispute ladder with configurable per-level SLA deadlines, a
keeper-triggered `PendingReview` stage, binding outcome records, and
finality rules integrated with payroll state.

---

## Dispute Reasons

Every dispute must be filed with one of the following structured categories.
Structured reasons make disputes filterable and reportable; free text is
intentionally bounded to prevent on-chain storage bloat.

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `NonDelivery` | Goods or services were not delivered |
| `QualityIssue` | Delivered work did not meet the agreed quality standard |
| `PaymentDispute` | Disagreement over payment amount or timing |
| `Other(text)` | Free-text reason; text is **capped at 256 bytes** (`ReasonTooLong` error if exceeded) |

Use `Other` only when none of the structured categories apply. The 256-byte cap
prevents a malicious filer from using an arbitrarily large string to bloat
on-chain storage at negligible cost.

The reason is stored in `DisputeDetails.reason` and is immutable — it does not
change through escalation, resolution, or appeal.

## State Machine

```text
file_dispute → Open @ Level1

  Open          + escalate_dispute  (now ≤ deadline)          → Escalated @ Level(N+1)
  Escalated     + escalate_dispute  (now ≤ deadline)          → Escalated @ Level(N+1)

  Open          + keeper_advance_stage (now > deadline)       → PendingReview @ LevelN
  Escalated     + keeper_advance_stage (now > deadline)       → PendingReview @ LevelN
  Appealed      + keeper_advance_stage (now > deadline)       → PendingReview @ LevelN

  *active*      + expire_dispute    (now > deadline)          → Expired   [terminal]
  PendingReview + expire_dispute    (now > review_deadline)   → Expired   [terminal]

  *active*      + resolve_dispute   (admin, L1/L2)            → Resolved  (appeal window = 3 days)
  PendingReview + resolve_dispute   (admin, L1/L2)            → Resolved  (appeal window = 3 days)

  Resolved      + appeal_ruling     (now ≤ appeal_deadline)   → Appealed  @ Level(N+1)

  *active*      + resolve_dispute   (admin, L3)               → Finalised [terminal]
  PendingReview + resolve_dispute   (admin, L3)               → Finalised [terminal]
```

**Terminal states:** `Finalised`, `Expired`.  
All further transitions are rejected with `AlreadyFinalised` or `AlreadyTerminal`.

---

## SLA Timer Design

Every dispute phase is governed by a **deterministic ledger timestamp** stored
in `DisputeDetails.phase_deadline`.  All comparisons use
`env.ledger().timestamp()` — the Stellar consensus timestamp, which is
manipulation-resistant and fully deterministic across validators.

### Phase deadline lifecycle

```text
t=0   file_dispute
        phase_started_at = t
        phase_deadline   = t + level_time_limit(Level1)     [default 7 days]

      ── within window (now ≤ deadline) ──────────────────────────────────────►
        escalate_dispute / resolve_dispute operate normally

      ── deadline passes (now > deadline) ────────────────────────────────────►
        keeper_advance_stage() triggers PendingReview
          phase_started_at = now            ← records exact breach timestamp
          phase_deadline   = now + pending_review_time_limit  [default 3 days]

      ── within review window (now ≤ review_deadline) ──────────────────────►
        resolve_dispute (admin) → Resolved or Finalised

      ── review deadline passes (now > review_deadline) ───────────────────►
        expire_dispute() → Expired [terminal]
```

### Boundary semantics

| Check performed | Condition | Result |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| `escalate_dispute` | `now ≤ deadline` | allowed |
| `escalate_dispute` | `now > deadline` | `TimeLimitExpired` |
| `expire_dispute` | `now ≤ deadline` | `DeadlineNotPassed` |
| `expire_dispute` | `now > deadline` | allowed |
| `keeper_advance_stage` | `now ≤ deadline` | `DeadlineNotPassed` |
| `keeper_advance_stage` | `now > deadline` | allowed |
| `appeal_ruling` | `now ≤ appeal_deadline` | allowed |
| `appeal_ruling` | `now > appeal_deadline` | `TimeLimitExpired` |

> **Note:** "at exactly the deadline" (`now == deadline`) is still *within*
> the window — the allowed side of every inequality.

---

## Escalation Tiers

| Level | Default SLA | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Level1 | 7 days (604 800 s) | Initial dispute — primary arbiter |
| Level2 | 7 days (604 800 s) | Escalated review — senior arbiter |
| Level3 | 7 days (604 800 s) | Final appeal — committee / external oracle (binding) |

Admin can override any level SLA with `set_level_time_limit`.  
Admin can set the `PendingReview` window with `set_pending_review_time_limit` (default 3 days).

## Contract Functions

### Lifecycle

| Function | Caller | Permissionless? | Description |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| `initialize(owner, admin)` | owner | — | One-time setup |
| `file_dispute(caller, agreement_id, reason)` | any | ✓ | Open a Level1 dispute; SLA clock starts |
| `escalate_dispute(caller, agreement_id)` | any | ✓ | Move to next tier within the SLA window |
| `keeper_advance_stage(caller, agreement_id)` | any | ✓ | After SLA elapsed: `Open/Escalated/Appealed → PendingReview` |
| `resolve_dispute(caller, agreement_id, outcome)` | **admin** | ✗ | Issue binding ruling; opens 3-day appeal window at L1/L2 |
| `appeal_ruling(caller, agreement_id)` | any | ✓ | Appeal a Level1/2 ruling within the appeal window |
| `expire_dispute(caller, agreement_id)` | any | ✓ | Close a stuck dispute after its current deadline |

### Configuration

| Function | Caller | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `set_level_time_limit(caller, level, seconds)` | **admin** | Override SLA for a tier (affects future phases) |
| `set_pending_review_time_limit(caller, seconds)` | **admin** | Override the `PendingReview` window (affects next keeper call) |
| `get_dispute(agreement_id)` | any | Read full `DisputeDetails` |
| `get_pending_review_time_limit()` | any | Read configured `PendingReview` window |

---

---

## Sequential Escalation Ordering

The contract **strictly enforces a Level1 → Level2 → Level3 walk**. There is
no legitimate way to bypass an intermediate tier, and the public API offers no
surface that would let a caller jump two levels in a single transaction.

### Why ordering matters

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| A party could escalate straight to Level3 and skip the Level2 SLA window, depriving senior arbiters of their review window. | `escalate_dispute` is a **one-tier step function** — see `next_level`. |
| A future maintainer could accidentally introduce a `target_level` parameter that allows skipping. | The contract has no `target_level` parameter; only `agreement_id` is accepted. |
| An admin could mutate `Dispute` storage directly to land at Level3. | The admin role only gates `resolve_dispute`, `set_level_time_limit`, and `set_pending_review_time_limit`; `DisputeDetails` storage is written solely from the state-machine entry points. |
| A higher-tier LA would be reached without paying the lower-tier SLA tax. | The Level2 SLA must elapse (or be observed as elapsed) before Level3 is reachable. |

### How the guard works

The contract derives the new tier purely from the current tier via a single
closed mapping — the `next_level` helper on `DisputeEscalationContract`:

```text
Level1 ──next_level()──► Level2 ──next_level()──► Level3 ──next_level()──► Err(MaxEscalationReached)
```

`escalate_dispute` reads `dispute.level`, asks `next_level` for the **next**
single tier, and writes that tier back. There is no parameter accepting a
target level, so any caller — admin, keeper, or external party — is bound by
this mapping. The only way to reach Level3 is:

1. `file_dispute` → `Open @ Level1`
2. `escalate_dispute` → `Escalated @ Level2` *(must respect Level1 SLA)*
3. `escalate_dispute` → `Escalated @ Level3` *(must respect Level2 SLA)*

…or, equivalently for the appeal path:

1. `file_dispute` → `Open @ Level1`
2. `resolve_dispute` → `Resolved @ Level1`
3. `appeal_ruling` → `Appealed @ Level2`
4. `resolve_dispute` → `Resolved @ Level2`
5. `appeal_ruling` → `Appealed @ Level3`

### Negative-space guarantees

The contract actively rejects any path that would skip a level:

| Attempt | Result |
|---------|--------|
| One `escalate_dispute` call from Level1 | Lands at Level2 (NOT Level3). |
| One `escalate_dispute` call from Level2 | Lands at Level3. |
| One `escalate_dispute` call from Level3 | Returns `MaxEscalationReached`. |
| `escalate_dispute` from `PendingReview` | Returns `InvalidTransition` (SLA window already declared breached). |
| Skip via a future `target_level` parameter | Impossible — no such parameter exists in the API surface. |

These guarantees are locked in by regression tests in §13 and the new tests
added under issue #890 in
`onchain/contracts/dispute_escalation/tests/test_escalation.rs`. The
relevant new tests are:

- the negative-space test that proves a single `escalate_dispute` call from
  Level1 lands at Level2 (asserting both the positive post-condition and
  the `! Level3` invariant);
- the positive-path test that walks `Level1 → Level2 → Level3` and asserts
  a fourth `escalate_dispute` returns `MaxEscalationReached`.

### Security review checklist

When modifying any code path that touches `dispute.level`, confirm:

- [ ] The only source of a new level value remains `next_level(...)`.
- [ ] No public function accepts a caller-supplied `EscalationLevel`.
- [ ] `assert_not_terminal` still runs before `next_level` is consulted.
- [ ] No test reaches Level3 in fewer than two `escalate_dispute` calls
      (or fewer than the appeal equivalent).

## `keeper_advance_stage` — Detailed Semantics

`keeper_advance_stage` is the permissionless function that drives automatic
SLA enforcement.  Key invariants:

1. **Stage-skip prevention** — it only ever transitions to `PendingReview`.
   It can never jump to `Resolved`, `Finalised`, or any other state.
2. **Idempotency** — a second call on an already-`PendingReview` dispute
   returns `AlreadyPendingReview` rather than silently succeeding, preventing
   duplicate event emission.
3. **Level preservation** — the dispute's `level` and `outcome` are not
   mutated; only `status`, `phase_started_at`, and `phase_deadline` change.
4. **No outcome authority** — the keeper sets no outcome; only the admin
   can write a binding ruling via `resolve_dispute`.

### Valid source states

| Status | Can keeper advance? |
|--------|---------------------|
| `Open` | ✓ (if `now > phase_deadline`) |
| `Escalated` | ✓ (if `now > phase_deadline`) |
| `Appealed` | ✓ (if `now > phase_deadline`) |
| `PendingReview` | ✗ `AlreadyPendingReview` |
| `Resolved` | ✗ `AlreadyResolved` |
| `Finalised` | ✗ `AlreadyFinalised` |
| `Expired` | ✗ `AlreadyTerminal` |

---

## `PendingReview` State

`PendingReview` signals that an SLA deadline has elapsed without a ruling
and the dispute urgently requires admin attention.

### Entering `PendingReview`

Called by any keeper (permissionless) after `phase_deadline` passes:

```
dispute.status         = PendingReview
dispute.phase_started_at = now          ← exact breach timestamp on-chain
dispute.phase_deadline   = now + pending_review_time_limit
```

### Exiting `PendingReview`

| Action | Condition | New state |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `resolve_dispute` (admin, L1/L2) | any time within review window | `Resolved` |
| `resolve_dispute` (admin, L3) | any time within review window | `Finalised` |
| `expire_dispute` | `now > review_deadline` | `Expired` |

### Blocked actions from `PendingReview`

| Action | Error |
|--------|-------|
| `escalate_dispute` | `InvalidTransition` — original SLA window has passed |
| `appeal_ruling` | `InvalidTransition` — dispute is not `Resolved` |
| `keeper_advance_stage` (again) | `AlreadyPendingReview` |

---

## Binding Outcomes

When `resolve_dispute` is called the `outcome` field is written to `DisputeDetails`:

| Outcome | Payroll effect |
|---------|----------------|
| `UpholdPayment` | Escrow releases funds to employer / payer |
| `GrantClaim` | Escrow releases funds to employee / claimant |
| `PartialSettlement` | Off-chain split; escrow releases per agreed ratio |
| `Unset` | *(invalid as a resolve argument — returns `InvalidTransition`)* |

Downstream contracts (payroll escrow, payment splitter) listen for
`dispute_resolved`, `dispute_finalised`, and `dispute_expired` events and
act on the `outcome` field to release or redirect funds.

---

## Finality Rules

```
Level3 resolution → status = Finalised  (terminal; no appeal possible)
Level1/2 resolution → status = Resolved (3-day appeal window opens)
  │
  └─ appeal_ruling within window → Appealed @ Level(N+1)
  └─ window passes with no appeal → de-facto binding (status stays Resolved)
```

- `Finalised` is a hard terminal state. Both `appeal_ruling` and
  `resolve_dispute` return `AlreadyFinalised`.
- `Expired` is the other terminal state — reached via `expire_dispute` after
  any phase deadline (including the `PendingReview` review window) passes with
  no admin action.

---

## Security Model

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Only admin resolves | `is_admin` check at the top of `resolve_dispute` |
| Cannot double-resolve | `AlreadyResolved` / `AlreadyFinalised` on every resolve path |
| No funds stuck | `expire_dispute` (anyone) closes abandoned disputes |
| No re-entry into terminal states | `assert_not_terminal` rejects all transitions on `Finalised`/`Expired` |
| Deadlines enforced on-chain | All time comparisons use `env.ledger().timestamp()` |
| Keeper cannot skip stages | `keeper_advance_stage` only reaches `PendingReview` — never `Resolved`/`Finalised` |
| Keeper is idempotent-safe | `AlreadyPendingReview` on repeated calls; no duplicate events |
| Level ordering enforced | `next_level` helper guarantees L1→L2→L3 sequence; `MaxEscalationReached` at L3 |
| `Unset` outcome rejected | `resolve_dispute` returns `InvalidTransition` if `outcome == Unset` |

## Usage Examples

### Standard fast-path resolution

```rust
// 1. Initialize
client.initialize(&owner, &admin);

// 2. Employee files dispute — SLA clock starts immediately
client.file_dispute(&employee, &agreement_id, &DisputeReason::PaymentDispute);

// 3. Admin resolves at Level1 — 3-day appeal window opens
client.resolve_dispute(&admin, &agreement_id, &DisputeOutcome::UpholdPayment);

// 4. Appeal window passes with no action → de-facto binding
//    (no further calls required; downstream reads DisputeDetails.outcome)
```

### Full escalation to Level3

```rust
// 1. File
client.file_dispute(&employee, &agreement_id, &DisputeReason::PaymentDispute);

// 2. Escalate to Level2 (within SLA window)
client.escalate_dispute(&employee, &agreement_id);

// 3. Admin resolves at Level2 — appeal window opens
client.resolve_dispute(&admin, &agreement_id, &DisputeOutcome::UpholdPayment);

// 4. Employee appeals to Level3
client.appeal_ruling(&employee, &agreement_id);

// 5. Admin issues final binding ruling at Level3 → Finalised
client.resolve_dispute(&admin, &agreement_id, &DisputeOutcome::GrantClaim);
// status = Finalised, outcome = GrantClaim, no further appeal possible
```

### Keeper-driven SLA enforcement

```rust
// 1. File dispute
client.file_dispute(&employee, &agreement_id, &DisputeReason::NonDelivery);
// phase_deadline = now + 604_800 (7 days)

// ...7 days pass, admin has not acted...

// 2. Any keeper (bot, cron job, anyone) advances the stage
client.keeper_advance_stage(&keeper_bot, &agreement_id);
// status = PendingReview
// phase_deadline = now + 259_200 (3-day review window)
// emits: DisputeSlaBreachedEvent { breached_at, review_deadline }

// 3a. Admin acts within the review window
client.resolve_dispute(&admin, &agreement_id, &DisputeOutcome::GrantClaim);

// — OR —

// 3b. Admin fails to act; anyone expires the dispute after review_deadline
client.expire_dispute(&anyone, &agreement_id);
// status = Expired → downstream escrow releases funds to payer
```

### Custom SLA configuration

```rust
// Shorten Level1 SLA to 1 hour for testing
client.set_level_time_limit(&admin, &EscalationLevel::Level1, &3600u64);

// Set a 6-hour pending-review window
client.set_pending_review_time_limit(&admin, &21_600u64);

client.file_dispute(&user, &agreement_id, &DisputeReason::PaymentDispute);
// phase_deadline = now + 3600

// After 1 hour + 1 second:
client.keeper_advance_stage(&keeper, &agreement_id);
// phase_deadline = now + 21_600
```
