//! # Dispute Escalation Contract
//!
//! Manages the full lifecycle of payment disputes across three escalation tiers
//! with configurable per-level SLA deadlines, a keeper-triggered `PendingReview`
//! stage, and binding outcome records.
//!
//! ## State Machine
//!
//! ```text
//! file_dispute → Open @ Level1
//!
//!   Open          + escalate_dispute  (within deadline)   → Escalated @ Level(N+1)
//!   Escalated     + escalate_dispute  (within deadline)   → Escalated @ Level(N+1)
//!
//!   Open          + keeper_advance_stage (deadline passed) → PendingReview
//!   Escalated     + keeper_advance_stage (deadline passed) → PendingReview
//!   Appealed      + keeper_advance_stage (deadline passed) → PendingReview
//!
//!   *active*      + expire_dispute    (deadline passed)   → Expired   [terminal]
//!   PendingReview + expire_dispute    (review deadline passed) → Expired [terminal]
//!
//!   *active*      + resolve_dispute   (admin, L1/L2)      → Resolved  (appeal window = 3 days)
//!   PendingReview + resolve_dispute   (admin, L1/L2)      → Resolved  (appeal window = 3 days)
//!
//!   Resolved      + appeal_ruling     (within window)     → Appealed  @ next level
//!
//!   *active*      + resolve_dispute   (admin, L3)         → Finalised [terminal]
//!   PendingReview + resolve_dispute   (admin, L3)         → Finalised [terminal]
//! ```
//!
//! **Terminal states:** `Finalised`, `Expired`. All further transitions are rejected.
//!
//! ## SLA Timer Design
//!
//! Every dispute phase is governed by a deterministic ledger timestamp stored
//! in `DisputeDetails.phase_deadline`.  The timeline for a single dispute is:
//!
//! ```text
//! t=0  file_dispute         phase_deadline = t + level_time_limit(L1)
//!       ── within window ──► escalate / resolve (normal path)
//!       ── deadline passes ──► keeper_advance_stage
//!              │ sets phase_deadline = now + pending_review_time_limit
//!              ▼
//!          PendingReview
//!       ── admin resolves ──► Resolved / Finalised
//!       ── review deadline passes ──► expire_dispute → Expired
//! ```
//!
//! All timestamp comparisons use `env.ledger().timestamp()` which is the
//! **consensus timestamp** — fully deterministic and manipulation-resistant.
//!
//! ## Keeper Transitions (permissionless)
//!
//! `keeper_advance_stage` and `expire_dispute` are permissionless: any caller
//! may trigger them once the on-chain timestamp satisfies the required
//! condition.  Both functions perform strict state checks so they cannot:
//! * skip escalation levels,
//! * resurrect a terminal dispute,
//! * be called twice on the same dispute (`AlreadyPendingReview` / `AlreadyTerminal`).
//!
//! ## Security Model
//!
//! | Invariant | Enforcement |
//! |-----------|-------------|
//! | Only admin resolves | `is_admin` check at the top of `resolve_dispute` |
//! | Cannot double-resolve | `AlreadyResolved` / `AlreadyFinalised` guard every resolve path |
//! | No funds stuck | `expire_dispute` (callable by anyone) closes abandoned disputes |
//! | No re-entry into terminal states | `assert_not_terminal` rejects all transitions on `Finalised`/`Expired` |
//! | Deadlines enforced on-chain | All time comparisons use `env.ledger().timestamp()` |
//! | Keeper cannot skip stages | `keeper_advance_stage` only advances to `PendingReview`, never skips to `Resolved`/`Finalised` |
//! | `PendingReview` is idempotent-safe | Returns `AlreadyPendingReview` on repeat calls |
//!
//! ## Integration with Payroll State
//!
//! Downstream contracts (payroll escrow, payment splitter) should listen for
//! `dispute_resolved`, `dispute_finalised`, and `dispute_expired` events and
//! act on the `outcome` field to release or redirect funds.
